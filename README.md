# MyPortfolio

My name is Alexander Gutting. I am a first-year ALIGN student from Boston, MA at Northeastern University concentrating in Computer Science. I also have a strong desire for data science and machine learning and I believe that this is the career path I want to go toward after I graduate. This is my portfolio in-progress that showcases the projects I worked on in the ALIGN program so far. Feel Free to check out my work .
