# MyPortfolio

My name is Alexander Gutting. I am a first-year ALIGN student at Northeastern concentrating in Computer Science. I also have a strong desire for data science and Artificial Intelligence and I believe that this is the career path I want to go towards after I graduate. This is my portfolio in-progress that showcases projects I worked on in the ALIGN program.
