If you click on a card before two other cards flip over or disappear, there will be some sort of bug where the
next two cards clicked on will stay the same (the front sides of those cards will not disappear). Unfortunately
I have been unable to fix this bug based on the way I have my code structured. In general, wait until the two
cards you clicked on are either hidden or flipped back, and then click on another card so that this does not
happen. Also, if using VSCode, before running the code, click on the explorer icon > Open Folder > name of the
recently downloaded folder and then run the code with memory_game.py.
